Thanks are due to my supervisor, Alasdair Rawsthorne, who has been both
supportive and helpful throughout every stage of the project. Also, many thanks
to Dave Bowden who constantly supplied me with all manner of tools and
components at short notice throughout. Finally, thanks too to my parents and
girlfriend who've been kind enough to put up with my ranting and assist with
proof-reading while working on this report.
