Personal 3D printers allow anyone to manufacture complex physical objects on
demand with minimal skill and effort. The Makerbot Cupcake CNC is a low cost,
easy to build 3D printer with a wide community of users. Though relatively
capable, the machine is held back by its primitive control electronics and
microcontroller.

New electronics based around a more powerful ARM microcontroller were produced
along with new firmware to control the printer. The system was built on the
widely used FreeRTOS and uses the \uIP{} TCP/IP stack allowing a clean, easily
extended design to be implemented.

The new system improved the print quality achievable by the printer thanks to
improved timing accuracy. Additional sensors also allowed the printer to act
with increased independence.
