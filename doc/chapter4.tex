		% TODO: Some intro
		
		Two boards were produced, one which hosts the Mbed and the electronics
		needed to drive the heaters, motors and temperature sensors and another
		which provides an interface between the end-stops and stepper controller
		boards. The system as installed in the printer is shown in figure
		\ref{fig:electronicsPhoto} with the major components labelled.

		To keep the system simple to build using readily available tools, 0.1"
		spaced electronics were used throughout. These are easy to work with using
		only a standard soldering iron and basic tools. Components of this size can
		also be used in prototypes built on a solderless breadboard.
		
		\subsection{Main Board}
			
			The main board will host the Mbed, electronics for controlling the
			heaters, reading from the temperature sensors and connecting to the
			stepper controller boards.
			
			A full circuit schematic and pin-out is given in Appendix
			\ref{sec:mainboardDiagrams}.
			
			\subsubsection{Layout \& Board}
				
				A prototyping board designed for working with DIP (Dual In-line Package)
				components such as the Mbed was selected (Figure \ref{fig:dipBoard} B).
				Conventional strip board (\ref{fig:dipBoard} A) would require many
				connections to be cut between the two columns of pins of the device. The
				particular design chosen also includes a ready-made ground-plane.
				
				\begin{figure}

					\caption{Types of prototyping board}
					\label{fig:dipBoard}
				\end{figure}
				
				\begin{figure}

					\caption{Top-level layout of main board (reset button and power
					         connections not shown)}
					\label{fig:mainBoard}
				\end{figure}
				
				The main board contains electronics for both low-power systems such as
				the Mbed and high-power systems such as the heater and motors and
				interference between these parts must be minimised. The high and lower
				power parts have been kept physically separate on the board (Figure
				\ref{fig:mainBoard}), each with their own power supply. The board also
				has a ground plane covering the whole board which also helps reduce
				noise\cite{pcb_design_notes}.
			
			\subsubsection{Heaters \& DC Motors}
				
				% TODO: Part numbers, specs and fact check!
				
				The heaters and DC motors in the extruder and platform operate at a
				higher voltage and are considerably higher-current than the
				microcontroller can produce on its output pins. To control these a
				transistor is required.  An IRLU8729PbF MOSFET (Metal Oxide Field Effect
				Transistor) was selected as it can switch large loads up to 58A with
				very little on-resistance (reducing energy wastage through
				heat)\cite{MOSFET}.
				
				% TODO: Photo of MOSFET
				\begin{figure}
					\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{diagrams/mosfetDiagram.pdf}
					\caption{Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET)}
					\label{fig:mosfetDiagram}
				\end{figure}
				
				The MOSFET has three connections called the gate, drain and source
				(Figure \ref{fig:mosfetDiagram}). When the voltage between the gate and
				the source is 0V, no current flows from the drain to the source. As the
				voltage between the gate and drain are increased, the current allowed to
				flow increases rapidly when it passes a certain threshold (Figure
				\ref{fig:mosfetPerformance}). By connecting the gate to a pin on the
				Mbed and the source to ground, a large current from a device such as a
				heater or motor can be switched by connecting it through the drain to
				ground.
				
				\begin{figure}
					\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{diagrams/mosfetPerformance.pdf}
					\caption{IRLU8729PbF Typical Transfer Characteristics (reproduced from
					`Fig 3', \cite{MOSFET})}
					\label{fig:mosfetPerformance}
				\end{figure}
				
				The behaviour of a MOSFET when the gate is left floating (disconnected)
				is generally undefined and can damage the component. When the Mbed
				powers on its output pins default to a floating state which could cause
				a MOSFET to unexpectedly turn on or become damaged. To prevent this
				happening the gate is connected to ground via a pull-down resistor. When
				the output pin is floating the gate is pulled to 0V by the pull-down
				resistor. When the output of the pin is not floating, the gate is pulled
				to that voltage overriding the pull-down resistor. A high resistance
				value is used so that the Mbed can easily override the pull-down
				resistor.
				
				Figure \ref{fig:mosfetUsage} shows the circuit used to control the two
				heaters and two motors using a MOSFET and pull-down resistor.
				
				\begin{figure}
					\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{diagrams/mosfetUsage.pdf}
					\caption{Example MOSFET circuit with pull-down resistor}
					\label{fig:mosfetUsage}
				\end{figure}
				
				When driving motors a `flyback diode' is usually used to prevent a
				voltage spike occurring when the power is removed from the motor. This
				voltage spike is caused by the magnetic field in the motor's coils
				collapsing. This is not included in the circuit as the MOSFETs used
				already contain an appropriate diode.
				
				It should be noted that this circuit does not allow the motors to be
				driven in both directions as this is not needed by the printer. If this
				was required, a more complex circuit (such as a H bridge) would be
				needed.

			\subsubsection{Power}
				
				The printer uses an ATX power supply unit (PSU) commonly found in
				desktop computers. A 20-pin connector containing both power and various
				control signals for the power supply is used to power the main board
				(see table \ref{tab:atxConnectors}).

				The Mbed is connected to the 5V standby supply allowing it to remain
				booted and power on the system on demand. The maximum power consumption
				of the Mbed is 200mA \cite{mbed}, well within the ratings of the ATX
				specification. The Mbed's on-board regulator provides a regulated 3.3V
				supply used by the Mbed and the low-power electronics attached to it.
				The 3.3V supply from the PSU is not used because the regulator in the
				Mbed offers a cleaner supply.
				
				To allow the PSU to be turned on by the Mbed, the power on signal is
				attached to a GPIO pin.  Because the Mbed is a 3.3V logic device a
				MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) is used to
				pull the 5V Power On signal to ground (thus turning on the Power Supply)
				using the 3.3V signal from the Mbed.
