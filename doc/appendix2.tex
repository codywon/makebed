\chapter{Example Prints}
	
	\label{sec:examplePrints}
	
	This appendix shows a representative selection of some of the objects that
	were printed as test cases for system testing. All designs printed were
	downloaded from Thingiverse or included as part of ReplicatorG.
	
	\section{Intricate Prints}
		
		\examplePrint{snake}{Flexible snake to test printing many thin fins}
		
		\examplePrint{starfish}{Starfish to test layerering appearence}
		
		\examplePrint{doorstop}{Doorstop to test large, smooth gradients}
		
		\examplePrint{butterfly}{Butterfly to test intricate islands of print}
		
		\examplePrint{rabbit}{Rabbit outline to test very thin structures}
		
	\section{Large Prints}
		
		\examplePrint{letter}{Letter `A' to test simple large shapes}
		
		\examplePrint{phoneDock}{Phone stand to test large gradients}
		
		\examplePrint{tooth}{Tooth to test large models with large overhanging areas}
		
		\examplePrint{joblot}{Multiple `metabricks' to test building multiple objects}
		
	\section{Functional Prints}
		
		\examplePrint{heart}{Rotatable heart to test simple mechanisms and
		                     multi-part objects}
		
		\examplePrint{whistle}{Whistle with pea printed inside to test precise,
		                       air-tight objects with built in sub-parts}
		
		\examplePrint{tweezers}{Tweezers to test flexible designs (frequently used
		                        to remove excess extrusion produced during
		                        self-cleaning)}
