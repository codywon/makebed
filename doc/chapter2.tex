	In this chapter the background of the project is described. The existing state
	of 3D printer electronics is described followed by an introduction to the
	tasks carried out by the firmware that drives them. Afterwards the ARM based
	`Mbed' microcontroller used in this project is introduced followed by
	`FreeRTOS', the operating system the project is built on.
